## üíª Requirements and Installation
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation) - preview looks better
- [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) - sending updates to `fzf`
- [Fuzzy Finder (fzf)](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) - allow for
  interaction with listed data
- [GitHub command line tool (gh)](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) - get the data
  from Github
- [Python](https://www.python.org) - used to parse and open custom URLs on different
  operating systems

```sh
# install this extension
gh ext install LangLangBart/gh-find-code
# upgrade
gh ext upgrade LangLangBart/gh-find-code
# uninstall
gh ext remove LangLangBart/gh-find-code
```

## üíÅ TIPS

### Alias
- The name `gh find-code` was chosen for its descriptive nature. For frequent use,
  consider setting up an alias.

```sh
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias ghfc='gh find-code'
# or add a custom 'BAT_THEME'/ 'EDITOR'
alias ghfc='BAT_THEME="Dracula" EDITOR="vim" gh find-code'
```

### Bat
- The color scheme of the preview is determined by the `BAT_THEME` environment variable.
  If not explicitly set by the user, the theme defaults to `Monokai Extended`.

```sh
# To view all default themes
bat --list-themes --color=never
# Recommended themes: 1337, Dracula, gruvbox-dark, Monokai Extended
# To launch this extension with the 'Dracula' theme
BAT_THEME="Dracula" gh find-code
```

### Editor
- The extension uses the `EDITOR` environment variable to determine in which editor
  the selected file will be opened, works with `nano`, `nvim/vi/vim`,  and
  `VSCode/VSCodium`.
- The code from opened files is stored temporarily and is removed when the program ends.

```sh
# Set the editor to Visual Studio Code
EDITOR="code" gh find-code
```

### Fuzzy Finder (fzf)
- Scroll the preview in larger steps by adding this snippet to your shell setup.

```sh
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
# scroll the preview in larger steps with ctrl+w/s
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="
--bind 'ctrl-w:preview-half-page-up,ctrl-s:preview-half-page-down'"
```

- See `man fzf` for `AVAILABLE KEYS` or
  [junegunn/fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables) for more
  details.
- NOTE: [How to use ALT commands in a terminal on
  macOS?](https://superuser.com/questions/496090/how-to-use-alt-commands-in-a-terminal-on-os-x)

### History
- The `gh_find_code_history.txt` file stores successfully completed unique commands. All commands
  can be viewed with <kbd>‚åÉ Control</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>. In case of duplicates, only the most
  recent entry is preserved. The maximum number of command entries is 250 by default, but this can
  be overridden by assigning a value to the `MAX_LINES_HISTORY` variable.

```sh
# Set the maximum number of stored commands to 1000
MAX_LINES_HISTORY="1000" gh find-code
```

### Pager
- If the `PAGER` environment variable is set to `less` or `bat`, when opening the destination file,
  it will automatically scroll to the matching line found.
