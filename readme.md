## üíª Requirements
- [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation) - preview looks better
- [Fuzzy Finder (fzf)](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#installation) - allow for
  interaction with listed data
- [GitHub command line tool (gh)](https://github.com/cli/cli#installation) - get the data
  from Github
- [Python](https://www.python.org) - used to parse and open custom URLs on different
  operating systems

```sh
# install requirements
brew install bat fzf gh python

# install this extension
gh ext install LangLangBart/gh-find-code
# upgrade
gh ext upgrade LangLangBart/gh-find-code
# uninstall
gh ext remove LangLangBart/gh-find-code
```

## üíÅ TIPS

### Search syntax
- GitHub REST API is used to search for code. The correct query syntax for searching code
  is detailed in the links below.
  - [GitHub Docs - Searching Code](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-code)
  - [GitHub REST API - search](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search/search#search-code)

<sub>‚ö†Ô∏è The search syntax differs between the WebUI and the REST API, with the latter not
supporting regex.</sub>

### Alias
- The name `gh find-code` was chosen for its descriptive nature. For frequent use,
  consider setting up an alias.

```sh
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
alias ghfc='gh find-code'
# or add a custom 'BAT_THEME'/ 'EDITOR'
alias ghfc='BAT_THEME="Dracula" EDITOR="vim" gh find-code'
```

### Bat
- The color scheme of the preview is determined by the `BAT_THEME` environment variable.
  If not explicitly set by the user, the theme defaults to `Monokai Extended`.

```sh
# To view all default themes
bat --list-themes --color=never
# Recommended themes: 1337, Dracula, gruvbox-dark, Monokai Extended
# To launch this extension with the 'Dracula' theme
BAT_THEME="Dracula" gh find-code
```

### Editor
- The extension uses the `EDITOR` environment variable to open files in your editor.
  Currently, only `VSCode` and `Vim` are supported. If the `EDITOR` variable isn't set,
  nothing will happen. You can specify your preferred editor when launching the extension.
- The code from these files is held temporarily and gets removed when this program ends.

```sh
# Set the editor to Visual Studio Code
EDITOR="code" gh find-code
```

### Fuzzy Finder (fzf)
- Scroll the preview in larger steps by adding this snippet to your shell setup.

```sh
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
# scroll the preview in larger steps with ctrl+w/s
export FZF_DEFAULT_OPTS="
--bind 'ctrl-w:preview-half-page-up,ctrl-s:preview-half-page-down'"
```

- See `man fzf` for `AVAILABLE KEYS` or
  [junegunn/fzf#environment-variables](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf#environment-variables)
  on GitHub for more details.
- NOTE: [How to use ALT commands in a terminal on
  macOS?](https://superuser.com/questions/496090/how-to-use-alt-commands-in-a-terminal-on-os-x)

### Good to know
- Fast movements between list items can cause the wrong file to be displayed in the
  preview.
- Be careful which files you open in your editor to avoid triggering something unintended.

### Pager
- If the `PAGER` environment variable is set to `less`, when opening the destination file, it
  will automatically scroll to the matching line found.
